# LDPC Neural Decoder Project Progress

## Overview
This project implements a Message-Centered Graph Neural Network (GNN) LDPC decoder with custom min-sum algorithm implementations for both variable and check node updates. The goal is to combine traditional LDPC decoding algorithms with neural network approaches for improved performance.

## Current Implementation
1. **Custom Variable Layer**: 
   - Successfully implemented a custom variable layer update using the min-sum algorithm with residual connections
   - Created `CustomVariableMessageGNNLayer` class that extends `MessageGNNLayer`
   - Implemented `variable_layer_update` method that follows traditional LDPC decoding principles

2. **Custom Check Layer**:
   - Working on implementing a min-sum check layer update
   - Will replace the neural network approach with traditional min-sum algorithm
   - Need to implement the check layer update function based on the provided code

3. **Combined Custom Decoder**:
   - Combined custom decoder that uses both min-sum variable and check updates
   - Helper functions to create index tensors for efficient message passing

4. **QPSK Modulation**:
   - The system uses QPSK modulation rather than BPSK
   - Implemented `AWGNChannel` class for simulating transmission through an AWGN channel

## What's Completed
- Custom variable layer implementation
- Custom check layer implementation
- Combined custom min-sum decoder
- Example scripts for both implementations
- Integration with the existing GNN architecture

## Next Steps
1. Create helper functions to easily instantiate the custom decoder
   - Develop a factory function that configures the custom decoder with appropriate parameters
   - Implement utility functions for creating PCM matrices and index tensors
   - Add documentation for each helper function with usage examples

2. Update example scripts to demonstrate the use of the fully custom decoder
   - Create a comprehensive example script showing the full pipeline from encoding to decoding
   - Add visualization tools to display decoding performance metrics
   - Include examples with different code rates and block lengths

3. Evaluate performance compared to our custom approach and traditional approaches
   - Implement BER (Bit Error Rate) vs SNR performance evaluation
   - Implement FER (Frame Error Rate) vs SNR performance evaluation
   - Compare with traditional belief propagation, scaled min-sum algorithms
   - Analyse convergence speed and computational complexity
   - Test performance under different channel conditions

4. Create a comprehensive comparison of different decoding approaches
   - Compare neural network-based approaches with traditional algorithms
   - Analyse trade-offs between performance (BER or FER) vs training complexity
   - Document findings in a structured report with visualizations
   - Identify scenarios where each approach performs best

5. Optimize the implementation for better computational efficiency
   - Identify and eliminate bottlenecks in the current implementation
   - Implement parallel processing where applicable
   - Optimize memory usage for handling larger code blocks
   - Consider hardware-specific optimizations for deployment

6. Develop an easy way to debug the decoder.
   - Create a configuration system for easy parameter tuning
   - Implement a command-line interface for batch processing
   - Add logging and visualization capabilities for debugging and analysis
   - Add print statements to see the changes of each stage 

## Project Structure
- `models/message_gnn_decoder.py`: Contains the main implementation of the Message GNN decoder
- `models/layers.py`: Contains implementations of various layers used in LDPC decoding
- `utils/channel.py`: Contains channel simulation code including QPSK modulation and AWGN channel
- `examples/custom_variable_layer_example.py`: Example script demonstrating the custom variable layer

## Notes
- The custom variable layer implementation has been tested and is working correctly
- The check layer implementation will follow a similar pattern to the variable layer
- Both implementations maintain compatibility with the existing GNN architecture
